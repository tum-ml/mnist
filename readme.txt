Instructions for running the code knn/knn.ipynb:
1. Open with Jupiter Notebook.
2. (Optional) Readjust the values of Ntr (No of training samples <=60000) and Nte (No of test samples <= 10000) according to your requirements. Currently Ntr=2000 and Nte = 1000.
3. (Optional) You may also adjust the value of k, but we have found k=15 to a reasonably optimal setting.
4. Run the code.

Results:
1. Accuracy is the indicator for the percentage of correctly classified test data points
